1. Move Turtle in a Straight Line

  a. Move the turtle forward the given distance drawing a line if the pen is down.
  
    forward(distance)
    fd(distance)

  b. Move the turtle backward the given distance drawing a line if the pen is down.
  
    backward(distance)
    back(distance)
    bk(distance)
	
  c. Move the turtle to the specified point drawing a line if the pen is down.
  
    drawXY(x, y)

  d. Move the turtle to the home position at the center of the screen drawing a line if the pen is down.
  
    home()	

2. Turning the Turtle

  a. Rotate the turtle right (clockwise) the given angle in degrees.
  
    right(angle)
    rt(angle)	
	
  b. Rotate the turtle left (counter-clockwise) the given angle in degrees.
  
    left(angle)
    lt(angle)

  c. Turn the turtle clockwise to the specified angle.
  
    setHeading(angle)	

3. Drawing Shapes - filled shapes are filled in with the current pen color.

  a. Draw a circle or filled circle centered on the current location with a given radius.

    circle(radius)
    filledCircle(radius)
  
  b. Draw an oval or filled oval centered on the current location with a given width and height.
 
    oval(width, height)	
    filledOval(width, height)
	
  c. Draw a square or filled square starting the current location and current direction with a given width.
	
    square(width)	
    filledSquare(width)

  d. Draw a rectangle or filled rectangle starting the current location and current direction with a given width and height.
	
    rectangle(width, height)	
    filledRectangle(width, height)
	
  e. Draw an arc.

    arc(width, height, startAngle, arcAngle)	
 
4. Controlling the Drawing Process

  a. Pick the pen up so that no drawing will take place as the turtle moves.

    penUp()
    pu()
	
  b. Put the pen down so that the turtle can draw as it moves.
  
    penDown()
    pd()	

  c. Set the location of the turtle without drawing.
	
	setXY()

  d. Set the color for the turtle to draw.
    
	setPenColor(color)
	
  e. Set the line width for the turtle to draw.  
    
    setPenSize(pixels)	
	
  f. Clear the screen to the default background color.	
    
	clearScreen()
    
  g. Clear the screen and set the given background color.
	
	clearScreen(color)	

  h. Show or hide the turtle on the screen.
  
    showTurtle()
    st()
	
    hideTurtle()
    ht()

  i. Set the delay between drawing commands in milliseconds. The command setDelay(500) would cause a half second delay. 
     The command setDelay(0) would be no delay at all. However, the screen would still be updated after each command and 
	 this slows down the drawing process. For the fastest drawing time use setDelay(-1) and then end your drawing commands with draw().
	 
	setDelay(delay)
	
  j. Have the hidden drawing buffer refresh the visible screen.

    draw()	

5. Input and Output Commands

  a. Display your message on the drawing screen. The default say location is the bottom left of the screen.
  
    say(message)
    say(message, x, y)
    say(message, x, y, fontSize)
    say(message, x, y, color)
    say(message, x, y, fontSize, color)	
	
  b. Display your message in a pop up dialog box.
  
    outputDialog(message)
	
  c. Display your message and retrieve your input using a popup dialog box.
  
    inputDialog(message)	

  d. Display your message in the NetBeans Output window.
  
    print(message)	

6. Informational Commands

  a. Returns a string with information about the turtle’s current position.
  
    about()
	
  b. Turns tracing on or off. Tracing on will report information as the turtle moves around.
  
    setTraceOn()	
    setTraceOff()
	
  c. Gets the heading angle in degrees.
	
    getHeading()

  d. Gets the turtles current x or y coordinate.
  
    getTurtleX()	
    getTurtleY()

7. Screen Constants - the defauls can be changed in turtle class DrawingPanel

  a. This constant contains the drawing panel width.
  
    PANEL_WIDTH	
	
  b. This constant contains the drawing panel height.
  
    PANEL_HEIGHT	

8. Color Constants - the following names can be used for colors

  Color.black, Color.blue, Color.cyan, Color.darkGray, Color.gray, 
  Color.green, Color.lightGray, Color.magenta, Color.orange, 
  Color.pink, Color.red, Color.white, Color.yellow
